    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "What you can accomplish with just Python has increased quite a bit in the last years as more sophisticated tools that plug in to the Jupyter widget ecosystem have been written.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of those tools is [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot/blob/master/examples/Index.ipynb), which provides a plotting tool in which the plot, and the lines, markers, labels and legend, all act as widgets. bqplot was developed using both Python *and* JavaScript. On the JavaScript side bqplot uses [d3](https://d3js.org/) to do the drawing in the browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "The widely-used plotting library [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/contents.html) also has a widget interface. Use `%matplotlib widget` in the notebook to have interactive plots that are widgets. Look at the documentation for [ipympl](https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl) for more details on using it as a widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is [ipyvolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which does three-dimensional renderings of point or volumetric data in the browser. It has both Python and JavaScript pieces but using it requires only Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last addition is in `ipywidgets` itself: the new `Output` widget can display any content which can be rendered in a Jupyter notebook. That means that anything you can show in a notebook you can include in a widget using only Python."
