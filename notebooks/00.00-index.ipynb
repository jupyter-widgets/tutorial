    "\n",
    "+ Special thanks to the dozens of [ipywidgets developers](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/graphs/contributors), including Jonathan Frederic, who wrote much of the code in the early years of ipywidgets, Sylvain Corlay, who kept the project going at a critical time, and Jason Grout, who currently leads the project and has nurtured the growth of the widget ecosystem.\n",
    "+ Several of the notebooks in this tutorial were originally developed as part of [ipywidgets](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by Brian E. Granger ([@ellisonbg](https://github.com/ellisonbg)) and Jonathan Frederic ([@jdfreder](https://github.com/jdfreder)).\n",
