    "## The Grid layout\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GridBox` class is a special case of the `Box` widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Box` widget enables the entire CSS flexbox spec, enabling rich reactive layouts in the Jupyter notebook. It aims at providing an efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the whole grid layout spec is exposed via the `layout` attribute of the container widget (`Box`) and the contained items. One may share the same `layout` attribute among all the contained items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following flexbox tutorial on the flexbox layout follows the lines of the article [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) by Chris House, and uses text and various images from the article [with permission](https://css-tricks.com/license/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics and browser support\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid_template_areas, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row. Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it's an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is now!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the concepts of Grid it's important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it's easy to confuse them with one another if you don't first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don't worry, there aren't many of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Container**\n",
    "\n",
    "The element on which `display: grid` is applied. It's the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"item item-1\"></div>\n",
    "  <div class=\"item item-2\"></div>\n",
    "  <div class=\"item item-3\"></div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Item**\n",
    "\n",
    "The children (e.g. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements are grid items, but sub-item isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"item\"></div> \n",
    "  <div class=\"item\">\n",
    "  \t<p class=\"sub-item\"></p>\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (\"column grid lines\") or horizontal (\"row grid lines\") and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-line](images/grid-line.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Track**\n",
    "\n",
    "The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them like the columns or rows of the grid. Here's the grid track between the second and third row grid lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-track](images/grid-track.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Cell**\n",
    "\n",
    "The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a single \"unit\" of the grid. Here's the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Grid Area**\n",
